# Restaurant-Website
This the project for my multipage website, created for my portfolio.

At the very beginning, I started thinking about the design, so I searched on websites like Framer for inspiration for my sushi restaurant website. For each section of the page, I considered how I should implement it, and whenever I came up with an idea, I wrote the code and compared it with the original design to make sure it matched. The main problem I encountered was making the design responsive for every device. Eventually, I realized that I could use the relative unit rem for all dimensions. This way, when I needed to make a section responsive, I only had to change the font size.

Another issue was the siteâ€™s loading time. Every time I needed to change something in my code, the website preview had to reload, which took a long time. This was caused by the large number of images I used, all taken from Unsplash. For example, on the home page, I had 14 images with an average size of 4 MB each. To solve this problem, I reduced the average image size to 500 KB, which made the loading time much shorter and smoother.

Besides these problems, creating this website went smoothly, and it took me one week to complete it.
